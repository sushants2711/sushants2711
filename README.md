👋 Hi, I’m Sushant Kumar Singh!
👀 I’m passionate about full-stack web development, software engineering, and bringing creative ideas to life through innovative applications.
🌱 Currently, I’m diving deep into React JS and MongoDB to sharpen my skills in building modern, scalable web applications.
💞️ I’d love to collaborate on exciting open-source projects, web development frameworks, or anything involving React, Django, or Node.js.
📫 How to reach me: Connect with me on GitHub or drop me an email at sushants2711@gmail.com
😄 Pronouns: He/Him
⚡ Fun fact: When I’m not coding, you’ll find me solving challenging algorithms or working on cool side projects—like the Django-powered music player I created in just a weekend!
